    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Unlike most streamers out there, I am an Autistic Streamer, from Brazil. I
      got the last and final diagnosis about my mental health status not long
      ago and it was discovered I have Asperger's Syndrome, the mildest type of
      Autism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have my own way to think, behave and react to things, so please be
      patient with me, respecting me and you will get the same from me. Mutual
      respect is all I ask from you, since you are here.
    </p>
